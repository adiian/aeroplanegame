Aeroplane Shooting Game Tutorial
=========

This is a small tutorial written in flash to create an aeroplane shooting game. The tutorial tries to be minimalistic to implment the basic features for such a game and to do it using as low code as possible.

It is structured in 5 parts:

 1. [Player Movement]
 2. [Shooting Bullets]
 3. [Adding Enemies]
 4. Collisions
 5. Scoring and HUD.

This tutorial can be used as a starting point for any type of vertical shooter game. Initially, I was planning to create a more realistic 2d aeroplane game and I didn't abandon the idea. After finishing this one, I plan to create a side scroller which involves some plane mechanics to simulate the taking off, flying/driving and landing of an aeroplane similar to the games from [here](http://aeroplanegames.net).
